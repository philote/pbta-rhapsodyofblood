    "description": "<p><em><strong>When the regent&rsquo;s clock fills,</strong></em> they blight the mortal world. The GM marks one:</p>\n<div><input type=\"checkbox\">A section of the region&rsquo;s population is cursed and made monstrous.</div>\n<div><input type=\"checkbox\">Day is short and nights are starless. ppMonsters walk the world every full moon.</div>\n<div><input type=\"checkbox\">Weather becomes unnatural and devastating.</div>\n<div><input type=\"checkbox\">Plagues strike a section of the population.</div>\n<p>If all are marked, <strong>the castle </strong>claims the mortal world and all is lost. Each player picks how their bloodline responds to the blight, and adjusts their stats:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em><strong>You stayed safe, at the cost of withdrawing from the world</strong></em>. Say which of your connections suffered in your absence. +1 Chalices, -1 Coins.</li>\n<li><em><strong>You fought to push it back, but your best mystics lost their lives</strong></em>. Say what their sacrifice achieved. +1 Swords, -1 Wands.</li>\n<li><em><strong>You took some of the taint into your family</strong></em>. Say what lingering malady the blight has left you with. +1 Wands, -1 Chalice.</li>\n<li><em><strong>You waged a shadow war keeping society safe at great cost to your warriors</strong></em>. Say which settlement still stands thanks to you. +1 Coins, -1 Swords.</li>\n</ul>",
