Lurking on the fringes of society, they fight a constant struggle against the dark blood within. In <span style=\"color: #ff7b7b;\"><strong>the castle</strong></span> they have the unique advantage of blending in with its inhabitants, giving them unmatched powers to infiltrate and gain information on the regent&rsquo;s plans.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 20px 20px; text-align: center;\"><em> Play the Half-Damned if you want to be inhuman. Your explorers can start with uncanny abilities other bloodlines must risk their soul to win, or maybe manifest claws, wings and chitin. Their proximity to the Regent's minions lets them send bloodline members in to infiltrate the Regent's rank and file, or issue them orders. </em></p>\n</div>\n<hr>\n<section class=\"grid grid-2col\">\n<div class=\"background\" style=\"border-right: dashed 1px black; padding-right: 10px;\">\n<h2 style=\"margin: 15px 0 10px;\">MAKING YOUR HEROES <em>(Bloodline)</em></h2>\n<h3 style=\"border: none;\">Stats</h3>\nPick one:\n<p><input type=\"checkbox\"><strong>Chalices 0 Swords 1 Coins -1 Wands 1</strong> if your bloodline is cursed with obvious signs of damnation and must live on the fringes of society.</p>\n<p><input type=\"checkbox\"><strong>Chalices -1 Swords 1 Coins 1 Wands 0</strong> if your bloodline is cursed with terrible hungers or a lingering blight, even as they appear completely human.</p>\n<p><input type=\"checkbox\"><strong>Chalices 1 Swords 0 Coins -1 Wands 1</strong> if one bloodline member in each generation shows the physical gifts of the curse, while the rest suffer the frailties imposed.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3 style=\"border: none;\">Traditions</h3>\n<em>Pick one from each or write one of your own:</em>\n<p><strong>Style:</strong> ragged fabrics and animal skins; fastidiously clean and modern clothing; anonymous peasant or low class clothing.</p>\n<p><strong>Lore:</strong> Ancient immortals with flawed memories; a voice whispering in your nightmares; religious texts that damn you but offer advice.</p>\n<p><strong>Name:</strong> A shared mark or feature; after your progenitor; what zealots and bigots call you.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3 style=\"border: none;\">History</h3>\n<p><strong><em>One bloodline hunted you as monsters before you forged a treaty.</em></strong> Set your pact each other to 1.
