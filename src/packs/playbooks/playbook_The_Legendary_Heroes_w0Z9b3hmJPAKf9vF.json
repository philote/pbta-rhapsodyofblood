Whether they&rsquo;ve been trained from birth to match the deeds of their forbears or brought to <span style=\"color: #ff7b7b;\"><strong>the castle</strong></span> by the winds of fate ignorant of their destiny, they&rsquo;re tenacious and audacious foes of the regent.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 20px 20px; text-align: center;\"><em> Play the Legendary Heroes if you want to be big damn heroes. Their abilities let them take blows for others and reveal secret fighting techniques, but their biggest strength is their heart. They can extend the hand of mercy to defeated acolytes and win their support, raise the morale of the local community and get resources in return, and forge a personal connection with the regent. </em></p>\n</div>\n<hr>\n<section class=\"grid grid-2col\">\n<div class=\"background\" style=\"border-right: dashed 1px black; padding-right: 10px;\">\n<h2 style=\"margin: 15px 0 10px;\">MAKING YOUR HEROES <em>(Bloodline)</em></h2>\n<h3 style=\"border: none;\">Stats</h3>\nPick one:\n<p><input type=\"checkbox\"><strong>Chalices 1 Swords 1 Coins 0 Wands -1</strong> if fate and coincidence keep bringing your bloodline to the castle despite their ignorance of mystical matters.</p>\n<p><input type=\"checkbox\"><strong>Chalices 0 Swords 1 Coins -1 Wands 1</strong> if your bloodline is tested from childhood for martial aptitude and trained to face the castle.</p>\n<p><input type=\"checkbox\"><strong>Chalices 0 Swords 1 Coins 1 Wands -1</strong> if your bloodline are world travellers with a fortune built on castle raids.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3 style=\"border: none;\">Traditions</h3>\n<em>Pick one from each or write one of your own:</em>\n<p><strong>Style:</strong> Stylish contemporary fashion; family crests and heirlooms; rustic or utilitarian clothing.</p>\n<p><strong>Lore:</strong> Picking it up as they go along; ancestor&rsquo;s crumbling journals; oral history passed from parent to child.</p>\n<p><strong>Name:</strong> A noble title; an inherited naming convention; bearers of the ________.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3 style=\"border: none;\">History</h3>\n<p><strong><em>One bloodline&rsquo;s legends taught you how to be heroes.</em></strong> Set your pact with them to 1.
